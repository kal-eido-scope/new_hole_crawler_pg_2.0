The evidence and corresponding translation are attached below.\n\nWhile this speech may not post clear and present danger as defined in the current legal system, we believe this is a concerning indicator regarding the political opinion, inclusivity, and moral value of this personnel.\n\nWe believe such speech does not align with the value of UIUC, or of any other school institution that pursues progression and justice.\n\nWe do not call for sanction upon this personnel, as we believe in the freedom of speech and due process. However, we do feel the necessity of writing this email to make sure the school and related faculties are aware of such a situation.\n\nSincerely, Anonymous. <附件，图片，翻译> edit：不用再发了，太多了就成了骚扰", "timestamp": 1646008819}}
