Let us assume that $n\\geqslant 1$ so that $S^{n+1}$ is simply connected and thus all vector bundles over $S^{n+1}$ is orientable. Also here we may assume that all vector bundles are smooth as clutching functions can be made smooth (this can be seen later). For a $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}-$bundle over $S^{n+1}$, the generic smooth section intersets the zero section at finite points by dimension reason, hence to compute the Euler class is equivalent to compute the intersecting number $\\sigma_{0}\\cdot\\sigma$. Let $\\alpha\\in\\pi_{n}(O(n+1))$ be a homotopy class, which can be always represented by a smooth map using smooth approximation, $\\tilde{\\alpha}:S^{n}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\\to S^{n}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ the smooth clutching map, and $\\eta=\\eta_{\\alpha}$ the resulting vector bundle (saying $E$ the total space), which is thus smooth. Take the trivializations $h_{\\pm}:E\\_{D^{n+1}_{\\pm}}\\to D^{n+1}_{\\pm}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Using $h_{+}$, we can construct a nowhere-zero section $\\sigma_{1}:D^{n+1}_{+}\\to E\\_{D^{n+1}_{\\pm}}$ of $\\eta|_{D^{n+1}_{+}}$ so that $h_{+}\\sigma_{1}(x)=(x,v)$ for some unit vector $v\\in\\mathbb{R^{n}}$. The bundle form of Tietze extension theorem will imply that we can extend $\\sigma_{1}$ to a section $\\sigma_{2}$ on the whole base space $S^{n+1}$. Then homotope $\\sigma_{2}$ to a smooth generic section $\\sigma$ such that $\\sigma|_{D^{n+1}_{+}}=\\sigma_{1}|_{D^{n+1}_{+}}$ as $\\sigma_{1}}$ is already smooth on the closed subset $D^{n+1}_{+}$. Then $\\sigma$ can vanish only on the lower open hemisphere, and thus  to compute the intersection number $\\sigma\\cdot\\sigma_{0}=\\sigma|_{D^{n+1}_{-}}\\cdot\\sigma_{0}|_{D^{n+1}_{-}}$, we only need to focus on the lower hemisphere.", "timestamp": 1654671597}, {"author_title": "", "blocked": false, "blocked_count": null, "can_del": false, "cid": 195142, "create_time": 1654672602, "is_blocked": false, "is_tmp": false, "name_id": 0, "text": "Transport the intersection number via trivialization $h_{-}$, and $\\sigma_{-}:=\\sigma|_{D^{n+1}_{-}}$ is now a vector field on $D^{n+1}$, and $\\mathrm{p}_{2}\\circ h_{-}\\circ\\sigma_{-}$ is just a smooth map $V:D^{n+1}_{-} to\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ that is nowhere vanishing on the boundary.

Since $w(x)=\\alpha(x)v$, and $v$ is a constant vector, we see that $w$ is the pushforward of the map $\\alpha$ along the bundle projection $p:O(n+1}\\to S^{n}$.

Note $S^{n+1}=D^{n+1}_{+}\\cup D^{n+1}_{-}$ is obtained by gluing two contractible spaces, namely the upper and lower semispheres along their boundary $n-$sphere.
