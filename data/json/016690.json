We can give you ten million. (Laughter, particularly among the women)\nDr. Kissinger: The Chairman is improving this offer.\nChairman Mao: By doing so we can let them flood your country with disaster and therefore impair your interests. In our country we have too many women, and they have a way of doing things. They give birth to children and our children are too many. (Laughter)\nDr. Kissinger: It is such a novel proposition, we will have to study it.", "timestamp": 1646716768}}
