An extremely high price was paid as over 8 million Ukrainians lost their lives during the Second World War.  He condemned all forms of Nazism and neo-Nazism, racism, xenophobia and related intolerance.  However, the draft resolution has nothing in common with the fight against Nazism; the penholder attempts to monopolize the victory over the Nazis in pursuit of political interests.  Ukraine had proposed a number of edits to the draft, but none of them were included and its impartial approach was ignored by the Russian Federation.  He commended the cynical attempt of the Russian Federation to present itself as a champion of combating neo-Nazism, while glorifying Stalinism.”", "timestamp": 1646227012}, {"author_title": "", "blocked": false, "blocked_count": null, "can_del": false, "cid": 39200, "create_time": 1646227204, "is_blocked": false, "is_tmp": false, "name_id": 1, "text": "Re 洞主: 那个反驳我看了啊，一是和你提的这个无关，二是很大一部分不就是“DW是反华媒体，所以不值一驳”吗。\n\n俄罗斯极右翼都当过副总理了，现在也还是高官，用光头党衰落来证明普京清理了新纳粹我觉得没什么说服力。", "timestamp": 1646227204}, {"author_title": "", "blocked": false, "blocked_count": null, "can_del": false, "cid": 39201, "create_time": 1646227295, "is_blocked": false, "is_tmp": false, "name_id": 1, "text": "金色黎明在希腊被橄榄和俄罗斯开极右翼大会好像也没啥关联", "timestamp": 1646227295}], "create_time": 1646224184, "cw": null, "hot_score": null, "is_blocked": false, "is_reported": null, "is_tmp": true, "last_comment_time": 1646227295, "likenum": 2, "n_attentions": 2, "n_comments": 5, "pid": 15052, "poll": null, "reply": 5, "text": "[tmp]\n美国CBS：U.S. votes against anti-Nazi resolution at U.N.\n另一个反对票国家是乌克兰\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-votes-against-anti-nazi-resolution-at-united-nations/\n有无懂哥给个解释？", "timestamp": 1646224184}}
